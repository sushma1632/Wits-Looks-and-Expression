	<p style="color: darkblue;font-size:40px;font-family: 'Grandstander', cursive;background-color: lightblue;">Entrepreneurs play a key role in any economy, using the skills and initiative necessary to anticipate needs and bring good new ideas to market. Entrepreneurs who prove to be successful in taking on the risks of a startup are rewarded with profits, fame, and continued growth opportunities. Those who fail, suffer losses and become less prevalent in the markets.

	<p style="color: darkblue;font-size: 30px;font-family: 'Grandstander', cursive;background-color: lightblue">Entrepreneurship is the ability and readiness to develop, organize and run a business enterprise, along with any of its uncertainties in order to make a profit. The most prominent example of entrepreneurship is the starting of new businesses.

	What Is Entrepreneurship
	In economics, entrepreneurship connected with land, labour, natural resources and capital can generate a profit. The entrepreneurial vision is defined by discovery and risk-taking and is an indispensable part of a nation’s capacity to succeed in an ever-changing and more competitive global marketplace.</p>

	<p style="color: darkblue;font-size:26px;font-family: 'Grandstander', cursive;background-color: lightblue">As an academic field, entrepreneruship accommodates many different schools and perspectives. It has been studied within disciplines such as economics, sociology and economic history. Some view entrepreneurship as allocated to the entrepreneur. These scholars tend to focus on what the entrepreneur does and what traits that an entrepreneur has. This is sometimes been referred to as the functionalistic approach to entrepreneurship. Others deviate from the individualistic perspective to turn the spotlight on the entrepreneurial process and immerse in the interplay between agency and context. This approach is sometimes referred to as the processual approach, or the contextual turn/approach to entrepreneurship.</p>

	<p style="color: darkblue;font-size: 35px;font-family: 'Grandstander', cursive;background-color: lightblue">Leadership in entrepreneurship can be defined as "process of social influence in which one person can enlist the aid and support of others in the accomplishment of a common task"in "one who undertakes innovations, finance and business acumen in an effort to transform innovations into economic goods". This refers to not only the act of entrepreneurship as managing or starting a business, but how one manages to do so by these social processes, or leadership skills.</p>
